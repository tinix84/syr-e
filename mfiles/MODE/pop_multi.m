classdef pop_multi < pop_single
% POP_MULTI         Class definition for a population to be
%                   used for multi-objective optimization 
%
% POP_MULTI is a SubClass of POP_SINGLE. The class 
% constructor works in the same way as that of POP_SINGLE,
% with the exception that an additional property is set:
%
%   pop.num_objectives      (number of objectives)
%
% All inputs and other properties are the same as for 
% POP_SINGLE -- type 'help pop_single' for more information. 
%
% The method ITERATE is now suited to optimize multi-
% objective problems. To that end, several other (hidden) 
% methods have been implemented: 
%
%   NON_DOMINATED_SORT()
%
%       a general implementation of NSGA-II's non-dominated 
%       sorting procedure. Sorts the current population
%       according to the domination level of the individuals.
%
%
%   pool = TOURNAMENT_SELECTION(pool_size, tournament_size) 
%
%       a general tournament selection procedure, that takes
%       [tournament_size] individuals randomly selected from
%       the offspring population and lets them compete with
%       the rankings and crowding distances as determining 
%       factors. The winning individual of each tournament
%       is inserted into [pool] until that [pool] contains
%       [pool_size] individuals. 
%
%   UPDATE_ALGORITHMS()
%    
%       Called from NON_DOMINATED_SORT(), updates some 
%       globaly changing values for the different algorithms. 
%       In pop_single, this is done in REPLACE_PARENTS(), but
%       as that step is not executed here, an extra method is
%       required. This updates for instance the [lbest],
%       [nbest] and [gbest] for PSO, and the temperature for
%       ASA.
