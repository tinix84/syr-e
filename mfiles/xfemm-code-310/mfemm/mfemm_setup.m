% mfemm_setup
%
% A large proportion of mfemm's functionality depends on interfaces to C++
% code. This code must be compiled into mex functions to be accessibly from
% the matlab or octave command line. Compiled mex files for your platform
% may be provided for your convenience with this package, in which case
% mfemm_setup will skip the compilation step (unless you call it as
% mfemm_setup(true) to force recompilation).
%
% If you do need/want to create the mex files, before running this script
% it must first compile some library files for use by the mex compiler.
% What is required for this depends on your system type.
%
% ------------------------   Linux Systems    ----------------------------- 
%
% On linux type systems the process is smoothly automated, and
% mfemm_setup.m will build the libraries using the system 'make' program,
% you will not need to do anything. If there are problems, you can try
% invoking the make command yourself, see the instructions for building the
% libraries using a makefile below.
%
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% ------------------------- Windows Systems ------------------------------- 
%
% Unfortunately Windows lacks somewhat the development environment
% of Linux systems. On Windows, it is easiest to install the Code::Blocks
% C++ IDE and mingw compiler suite which usually comes with the
% Code::Blocks package. You will also require the gnumex project which
% allows you to use the mingw compiler as the Matlab mex compiler, there is
% further information about gnumex below.
%
% mfemm_setup will call Code::Blocks automatically if it is installed in
% the normal location to build the required libraries. You shouldn't need
% to take any manual building steps, but you will probably have had to open
% Code::Blocks at least once before running mfemm_setup doing this to
% select the default compiler. If required, there is also information on
% manually using Code::Blocks to build the libraries below.
%
% Code::Blocks can be obtained from here: www.codeblocks.org
%
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% In both cases mfemm_setup requires requires that you have a C++ compiler
% set up for use by Matlab or Octave (Octave will not have a problem thanks
% to its seamless integration with gcc). In Matlab you must have previously
% run:
%
% mex -setup
%
% And selected a valid C++ compiler before attempting to run this
% mfemm_setup function. For Linux, or Octave on Windows, the system gcc
% compiler will be ideal.
%
% For Windows, the compilers supported by Matlab vary over time. However,
% you will need to build the mex files using the same compiler with which
% you created the libraries earlier. Often there is a free version of
% Microsoft Visual C++ which will work, but no project files are provided
% for this. The gnumex project provides a way to use gcc on Windows with
% Matlab (this will work with the compiler which comes with code::blocks,
% mingw). gnumex can be found on sourceforge, here:
%
%                 http://gnumex.sourceforge.net/

%
% = Instructions for building required libraries manually using Makefile =
%
% On your linux system, mfemm_setup will do this automaticaly without any
% action required from you, but if you want to do it manually for some
% reason you can do the following. First change directory to the mfemm top
% level directory. In this directory run the following command:
%
% make
%
% That should be it! Now you can rerun mfemm_setup to complete the process.
%
%
% ===  Instructions for building required libraries with Code::Blocks   ===
%
% Code::Blocks can be obtained from here: www.codeblocks.org
%
% If Code::Blocks has been installed in the usual directory, mfemm_setup
% should find it and call it using command line arguments to build the
% libraries without you having to do anything. However, if for some reason
% this doesn't work. to build the required library files, open the file
% mfemm_libs.workspace file in the same directory as this funtion in
% Code::Blocks. This Code::Blocks workspace contains several projects all
% of which must be compiled before running the rest of the setup. You will
% want to build the "Release" versions of these. Once this has been done
% simply select 'build workspace' from the build menu and Code::Blocks will
% build all of the projects. Next rerun mfemm_setup to create the mex
% functions.
%
% Note that you are building for Matlab will want your Matlab mex compiler
% to be the same as your Code::Blocks compiler. The gnumex project
% (available elsewhere) can help you use the gcc with Matlab.
