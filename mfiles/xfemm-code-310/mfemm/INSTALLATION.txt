Instructions for installing mfemm can be found by running the 
command:

help mfemm_setup

at the Octave or Matlab command prompt. This displays the
the following information:

  mfemm_setup
 
  A large proportion of mfemm's functionality depends on interfaces to C++
  code. This code must be compiled into mex functions to be accessibly from
  the matlab or octave command line. Compiled mex files for your platform
  may be provided for your with this package, in which case mfemm_setup
  will skip the compilation step (unless you call it as mfemm_setup(true)
  to force recompilation). 
 
  If you do need/want to create the mex files, before running this script
  you must first compile some library files for use by the mex compiler.
  There are two ways to do this. On linux type systems it is probably
  easiest to use the provided Makefile in the mfemm directory. On windows,
  it is probably easiest to use the Code::Blocks C++ IDE. Several project
  and workspace files for the free Code::Blocks IDE are provided to ease
  this process. Instructions are provided below for creating the required
  libraries using Code::Blocks or using the Makefile.
 
  mfemm_setup requires requires that you ave a C++ compiler set up for use
  by Matlab or Octave (of course Octave will not have a problem thanks to
  its seamless integration with gcc). In Matlab you must have run 
 
  mex -setup
 
  And selected a valid C++ compiler before attempting to run this
  mfemm_setup function. For linux the system gcc compiler will be perfect.
  The free windows compilers supported by Matlab vary over time, but often
  there is a free version of Microsoft Visual C++ which will work. The
  gnumex project provides a way to use gcc on Windows with Matlab if
  desired.
 
  
  ===   Instructions for building required libraries using Makefile     ===
 
  On your linux system change directory to the mfemm top level directory.
  In this directory run the following command:
 
  make
 
  That should be it! Now you can rerun mfemm_setup to complete the process.
 
 
  ===  Instructions for building required libraries with Code::Blocks   ===
 
  Code::Blocks can be obtained from here: www.codeblocks.org
 
  To build the required library files, open the file mfemm_libs.workspace
  file in the same directory as this funtion in Code::Blocks. This
  Code::Blocks workspace contains several projects all of which must be
  compiled before running the rest of the setup. You will need to manually
  ensure that those projects which have a 'Library' build target have this
  selected. The projects which have a 'Library' target are fmesher, fsolver
  and fpproc. The other projects are always libraries and you will want to
  build the "Release" versions of these. Once this has been done simply
  select 'build workspace' from the build menu and Code::Blocks will build
  all of the projects. Once this is done rerun mfemm_setup to create the
  mex functions. 
 
  Note that you are building for Matlab will want your Matlab mex compiler
  to be the same as your Code::Blocks compiler. The gnumex project
  (available elsewhere) can help you use the gcc with Matlab.
