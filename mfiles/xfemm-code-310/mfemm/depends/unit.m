function u = unit(a, dim)
%UNIT   Normalizing vectors with respect to their magnitude.
%   If A is a vector (e.g. a P×1, 1×P, or 1×1×P array):
%
%      U = UNIT(A) returns A normalized for magnitude (see function MAGN).
%      If A represents a vectorial quantity, such as the position of a
%      point, U = UNIT(A) can be described as a unit vector aligned with A.
%
%      U = UNIT(A, DIM) is equivalent to UNIT (A) if DIM is the
%      non-singleton dimension of vector A; it returns a vector of ones
%      if DIM is a singleton dimension.
%
%   If A is an N-D array containing more than one vector:
%
%      U = UNIT(A) contains the elements, normalized for magnitude, of the
%      vectors constructed along the first non-singleton dimension of A.
%
%      U = UNIT(A, DIM) contains the elements, normalized for magnitude, 
%      of the vectors constructed along the dimension DIM of A.
%
%   Example:
%   A 5×3×2 array may be considered to be a block array containing ten
%   3-element vectors along dimension 2. In this case, its size is denoted
%   by 5×(3)×2. If A is a 5×(3)×2 array, U = UNIT(A, 2) is an array of the
%   same size containing unit vectors.
