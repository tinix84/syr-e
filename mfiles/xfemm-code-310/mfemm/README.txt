1. Introduction

mfemm is a collection of m-files (with .m extension) for use 
with Octave or Matlab, for the generation of finite problem 
definitions suitable for the program FEMM, and the pfemm 
system (based on FEMM). Also included are some useful C++ code 
files which provide a direct interface between Octave/Matlab and 
pfemm. Further information on FEMM and pfemm is provided in 
Section 3.

The provided m-files can be used for the creation of 
magnetic finite element problem definitions, and the 
generation of associated .fem files suitible for reading by 
the pfemm system. The m-files also have some routines for 
problem visualisation and reading of solution files produced
by the pfemm system. Ultimately a set of post-processing 
algorithms are planned, none of these are yet implemented.


2. Licencing

All m-files provided in this package are licenced under the 
Apache Version 2.0 licence. A copy of the text of this licence 
is supplied in the file LICENCE.txt. This licence also applies 
to the C++ files in the top level directory which provide a 
mex interface to Octave/Matlab for the pfemm routines fmesher 
and fsolver. fmesher and fsolver have their own licencing terms 
and are not covered by the Apache Version 2.0 licence. You 
should take care to adhere to the licencing of these separate 
codes.

The mfiles in this directory may be modified and redistributed 
according to the Apache Version 2.0 Licence, but the author(s) 
request that you would also send any bug fixes or improvements to 
them so that others can benefit as you have.

3. History

FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics, www.femm.info) is a high 
quality open source program developed by Dr. David Meeker for the 
solution of 2D planar and axisymmetric finite element problems 
for magnetics, current flow and heat flow. While FEMM had a well
developed interface for Octave/Matlab, there were issues with 
the speed and reliability of the connection. This was 
particularly the case for Linux systems where FEMM could not 
be installed run natively, requiring to be run under WINE, and 
the efficient Windows based ActiveX interface was replaced with 
a file based method.

To speed the creation of Finite Element problem files from 
Octave/Matlab the system of m-files provided with this package 
was created. In parallel, a separate project (pfemm) was created 
to allow the native compilation and running of the core magnetics 
solution and meshing algorithms on non-windows systems. As FEMM 
was licenced under the Alladin Free Public Licence, the pfemm 
project was licenced under the same terms.


4. Using the Package

The documentation for mfemm is a work-in-progress, but there is a
detailed tutorial in the examples directory in the form of a heavily 
commented m-file. This gives a good overview of the system.

Installation instructions can be found in INSTALL.txt in the same
directory as this readme file.

If you improve the m-files in any way, please do send your
improvements to the author for inclusion in the package.
